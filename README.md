## Project Overview

Organizations frequently need to classify data to support decision-making.
For example, a healthcare provider may want to predict whether a patient has a specific condition based on lab results,
or a business may classify customer behavior to tailor marketing strategies.
Machine learning classification models help automate these decisions by recognizing patterns in historical data.

This project demonstrates the ability to apply classification modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Analyze feature distributions and consider feature selection.
- Train and evaluate a classification model.
- Compare different classification approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmate’s project.
